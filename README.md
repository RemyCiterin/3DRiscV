# blarney-experiments
Some experimentations with the blarney DSL for hardware synthesis


# TODO

- test core on nexys-video board
- add support for SDRAM for the core (the driver is implemented, I need to add it to the
    TileLink interconnect)
- Implement a bootloader
- run UNIX on the ULX3S board
